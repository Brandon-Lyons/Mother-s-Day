Mother-s-Day
============

This is a work-in-progress iphone app for my mom as a Mother's Day gift. At presentation time (a.k.a. Mother's Day) I hope to have implemented a photo slideshow/carousel, radio, and YouTube api integration. As time goes on I plan on continually think of and add more features for her. It all depends on her input.

PHASE 1: Planning out the layout using Bootstrap for the framework. Downloading the needed software.
